Copy of the famous mobile phone game created by FDG Mobile Games

I made this game in 2010 or 2011, something like that, and I've just found it in some old folders in a backup, so I decided to release it.

It's made in HTML5, supports tactile gesture (well, it should).

I took the original 30 levels of the game, so it's really like the original!

(The menu is in french, just click on the first item, "Charger la partie", it will continue - or create - a game)
