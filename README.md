Copy of the famous mobile phone game created by FDG Mobile Games

I made this game in 2010 or 2011, something like that, and I've just found it in some old folders in a backup, so I decided to release it.

It's made in HTML5, supports tactile gesture (well, it should).

I took the original 30 levels of the game, so it's really like the original!
